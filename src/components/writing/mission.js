export const mission = `I am fascinated by the concept of somatizing the digital experience, which involves bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds to create a more immersive and embodied interaction with technology. In this context, embodied means grounding the digital experience in bodily sensations and physical presence, allowing users to engage with technology in a more natural and intuitive way. By incorporating elements such as haptic feedback, gesture recognition, and augmented reality, we can enhance the sense of presence and make technology feel more integrated into our everyday lives.

One aspect of somatizing the digital experience that captivates me is its profound impact on the imagination. By blurring the boundaries between the real and virtual realms, we can unlock new realms of creative possibilities. Virtual reality, for instance, allows users to explore fictional worlds, participate in fantastical scenarios, and interact with characters beyond their wildest dreams. This seamless integration of the digital with our physical selves enables us to extend the limits of our imagination and opens doors to innovative applications in fields such as education, therapy, and entertainment.

In my pursuit of creating artificial intelligent systems, I am committed to upholding principles of humanism, accessibility, and ethical diversity. Humanistic AI should prioritize the well-being and empowerment of individuals, ensuring that technology enhances human experiences rather than replacing or alienating them. Additionally, I strongly believe that AI systems should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or background. By embracing diversity in views and perspectives during the development of AI, we can avoid biased outcomes and create technology that is inclusive and beneficial for all of humanity. Through my work, I aspire to contribute to a future where technology enriches our lives and brings us closer together in a more harmonious and empathetic digital world.

 I have a strong academic and professional background in deep learning and AI in education. I have a master's degree from UPenn, where I focused on developing and evaluating deep learning models for various educational tasks. I have also worked as an AI engineer in several educational projects, where I applied AI techniques to enhance the learning outcomes and experiences of students with disabilities. I am interested in how government policies can leverage AI to make education more accessible and inclusive, while respecting the privacy and dignity of learners.`;
